PyIface is a module created to iterate, view and control the network interfaces on a Unix flavored operating systems.

Currently it wokrs on Linux and *BSD flavors.

There are a few python modules that can do the same but they lack features like IPv6 support others can only view 
the current settings and can't set them. I decided to create a module that can perform almost every possible action
on a network interface. This is the result from this effort.

If you find bugs or missing features that you need do not hesitate to contact me!
